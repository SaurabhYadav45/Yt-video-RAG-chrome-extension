## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. üîó User opens a YouTube video with the extension enabled.
2. üìú The extension checks for an English transcript.
   - ‚úÖ If found: cleaned & chunked ‚Üí embedded ‚Üí stored in Qdrant.
   - ‚ùå If not found: audio is transcribed using **Whisper**.
3. üåç If the transcript is in another language, it's translated to English using **Gemini API**.
4. üí° RAG pipeline (via LangChain) is triggered to answer user queries about the video content.
5. üí¨ User interacts via a chatbot embedded directly on the YouTube page.
